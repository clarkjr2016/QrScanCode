## Overview

This is my solution to the front end mentor qr code scan card challenge. The technical part of actually coding this out wasn't that difficult but this is the first time in my coding career where I've actually utilized a workflow process for building something. It was difficult because I typically have had a free flowing style when coding which has led to issues in the past. I'm really appreciative of front end mentor for providing me with this idea for workflow and I'm excited to work on future projects using it.

## My process

I first started by creating a remote repository on github and then created a local repository with all of the downloaded files that I got from front end mentor. I then connected the two. I've used git and github for years and I never realized that the word typed after `add` in `git remote add somename` is a nickname of my choosing.

After connecting the repositories, I then hosted my project on github using github pages.

I then reviewed the design files and mentally made notes of how I would approach the problem.

I then practiced "Separation of Concerns" by building out my HTML first, and then began to apply the styling.

### Built with
